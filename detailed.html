            <div id="header"><h1>Detailed History of the Treaty of Waitangi</h1></div>
            <div id="navbar">The treaty was drafted in both English and Māori, but discrepancies between the two versions have led to ongoing debates and legal disputes regarding its interpretation and implementation. The English version granted the Crown sovereignty over New Zealand, while the Māori version granted the Crown kawanatanga, which can be translated as governance or authority.The treaty was intended to protect the rights of Māori while allowing for British settlement and development. It promised Māori the rights and privileges of British subjects and guaranteed their ownership of lands, forests, and other possessions. However, many Māori argue that the treaty has not been fully upheld, leading to significant injustices, including land confiscations, cultural suppression, and social disparities.</div>
            <div id="sidebar">Since the late 20th century, there have been efforts to address these grievances through treaty settlements and initiatives aimed at promoting Māori rights, language, and culture. The Treaty of Waitangi remains a central and contested aspect of New Zealand's history and ongoing national dialogue about identity, sovereignty, and reconciliation.</div>
